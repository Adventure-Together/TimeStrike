\section{The Lost}
The Lost is a term used for the AI in TimeStrike. The Sentience as well as all the Mobs and Monsters under its control belong to the Lost. Lost to time, these prior inhabitants will do everything in their power to ensure that no one survives. During a game of TimeStrike the Lost challenge players and provide loot.

The Lost will be spawned in and controlled by drawing from the Sentience Deck. Players can attack the Lost in the same way they would attack units belonging to another player.

\subsection{Attacking the Lost}
A Character that deals damage to a Lost unit as the result of an attack or ability skill draws one loot card and places it in their inventory. The Lost do not roll for Defense; instead refer to the Sentience card’s listed "Defense” value. This shows the number of blocks a unit must surpass when attacking.

Player units may target the Sentience with attacks and ability skills, and draw loot if the attack or ability skill would deal damage to the Sentience. However, the Sentience cannot be defeated, and any damage the Sentience would receive from any source is not tracked.

\textit{Note: Lost units cannot receive buffs or curses.}
