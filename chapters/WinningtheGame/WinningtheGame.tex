\section{Winning the Game}

To win the game, 2 conditions must be met: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1st: Defeat all your opponents' team
    \item 2nd: Defeat any Monsters belonging to the Sentience. Then once all the Monsters are gone deal once last attack to Fear to remove Fear from the board. 
\end{itemize}

The first player to meet these conditions wins the game. 

If each player's team is defeated before the Monsters are defeated, then the game ends and no players win. The Lost wins!
