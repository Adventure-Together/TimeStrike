\section{Starting TimeStrike}
This section explains how to start once the board is built, and the players have learned some of the basics above. 

\subsection{Determining Turn Order}
Players will first determine the turn order for drafting teams, placing their Characters on the board, and starting the game. 

Roll a D20 for each player. The player with the highest roll goes first and place continues clockwise. 

\subsection{Building/Drafting Teams}
When building teams, players will pick three Characters each for a standard-length game. Players can agree to use more or less Characters depending on how long or difficult of an experience they want. 

Starting with the first player, take turns picking one Character at a time until all Characters for each team have been picked. 

\subsection{Placing Teams}
In the same order as drafting teams, the players will then pick an unoccupied Edge of the map to start their entire time. Characters belonging to the same team must be placed adjacent to each other. 

\subsection{Initiative}
The first player in the turn order will start the game, and play will continue in a clockwise direction. Sentience cards will change who the first player is throughout the game, but the clockwise order will remain. 

With this knowledge, the initiative can be set for the first round, and the first player may take their first turn.
